Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the application of engineering principles to the design and maintenance of software sysytems.
its importances are - quality development, scalability and security.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The key milestones are - The pioneering days, The internet age and cloud computing/AI age


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The phases are - planning, design, implementation, testing, deployment and maintenance


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is linear and predictive while Agile is iterative and adaptive
Agile involves customers throughout the project while waterfall only involves customers at requirement gathering phase.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software developer designs, code and troubleshoots
QA engineer tests and report defects
Project manager plans, allocate resources, monitor progress and stakeholder interaction.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs improves productivity, enhances code quality, better debugging and collaboration
VCS improves version management, changes tracking, backup, recovery and security.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Software engineers face several challenges, these include;
Technical challenges such as scalability, managing complexities, integration
Non technical challenges such as communication, time management, collaboration.
Business challenges such as budget constraints and regulatory compliance.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of designing text promptsto elicit desired responses from language models. Its goals are to improve response accuracy, and enhance user experience.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
